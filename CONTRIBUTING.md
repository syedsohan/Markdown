## ‚ú® Style Guides For Git Commit Messages :memo:

#### Here's a list of some good to have points, that can add more value to your contribution logs.

- Use the present tense (example: "Add feature" and not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood (example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...").
- Limit the first line (also called subject line) to 50 characters or less.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what, why, vs, and how.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

For more detailed reference to the above points, refer [here.](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

## üí• Issues:

For major changes, you are welcome to open an issue  about what you would like to contribute. Enhancements will be appreciated.
